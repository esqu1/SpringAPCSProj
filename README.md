Research suggests that there is a strong correlation between size of a team name and amazingness of said team's
final submission.

Project Name: Wrecking Ball<br />
(This is to distinguish it from Dennis's project from term one of Intro â€“ Wreckerball.)<br />
(Coincidentally, this team name also has its roots in term one of Intro...)<br />


DEVELOPMENT LOG:<br />

5/20/15<br />
Brandon created this directory.

5/22/15<br />
Brandon made a couple of skeleton files for classes that might come in handy.

5/25/15<br />
Brandon made a simple paddle that could follow the player's mouse.

5/26/15<br />
Brandon started writing an abstract Brick class and wrote the constructor for a rectangular prism subclass.<br />
Dennis started writing the Board class, which will contain all objects involved in the game.<br />
Dennis then modified the WreckerBall class to allow users to resize the board (rather, resize everything in
the game window), rotate the board, zoom toward and away from the board, and reset to default settings.

5/27/15<br />
Brandon figured out how to draw brick prisms with irregular polygons as faces. He also started working on a method that would detect collisions between the ball and a prism. <br />
Dennis made the board 1x1 in the hopes that this would make coding the levels simpler.

5/28/15<br />
Brandon figured out how to work textures onto the bricks. <br />
Dennis realized that his board scaling idea was stupid and that his former board resizing idea was flawed.<br />
Dennis then came up with an outline for detecting collisions between a ball and a prism.

5/29/15<br />
Dennis reimplemented zooming and window resizing using a combination of the camera() and perspective() functions.<br />
Dennis then redid Brandon's texture-drawing mechanism so that the textures would not be scaled as they were drawn.<br />
Dennis then started writing the collision detection function.

5/30/15<br />
Dennis continued writing the collision detection function, which he realized was mad work.<br />
Taking a break, Dennis added lighting to the game, and then wrote a lot of useful mathematical functions to be used in the collision detection function, as well as anywhere else they may be needed.<br />

5/31/15<br />
Dennis realized that Processing's left-hand coordinate system had been causing his vector determinants to return the negatives of the values he was expecting.<br />
After correcting that issue, Dennis wrote a function for reflecting balls off the edges of prisms.<br />
Dennis then fixed an issue that occured when balls collided with vertices, finishing off the ball-bouncing mechanism for prisms.<br />
Dennis then created a Container class that would hold various elements in the board (because the ArrayList class was too inefficient for him).

6/1/15<br />
Brandon started writing a Cylinder class for a new kind of brick, while Dennis started writing a Sphere class.<br />
Dennis then created an M.java class that would house all static math-related methods.<br />
Dennis then made some changes in order to accomodate a menu.<br />

6/2/15<br />
Dennis made a draw() method for cylinders that only allowed for solid colors (rather than textures).

6/3/15<br />
Brandon wrote code for a menu screen with a colliding sphere background.<br />
Dennis made a ball-bouncing mechanism for cylinders, which was much simpler than the one for prisms.

6/4/15<br />
Dennis made a ball-bouncing mechanism for spheres, which was simpler than both the previous ones he had written.<br />
Dennis then started working on a way to add textures to cylinders.

6/5/15<br />
Dennis finished off the texturing mechanism for cylinders.<br />
Dennis then made a nice out-of-bounds detection mechanism for balls.<br />
Dennis then spent some time working on a way to add textures to spheres, but couldn't get it quite right.

6/6/15<br />
Dennis created a superb texturing mechanism for spheres.<br />
Dennis then changed the draw() functions of prisms and cylinders to make them much more efficient and to make the code more consistent.<br />
Dennis then allowed spheres to spin around a central axis and put a spinning model of the Earth on the board.<br />
Dennis then used Photoshop to make a high-resolution gray brick texture that could be used later on.

6/7/15<br />
Brandon created an options menu that allows the user to change the smoothness of the game.
